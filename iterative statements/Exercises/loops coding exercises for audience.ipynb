    "Problem Statement:Counting no.of vowels in a string using for loop or while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program to count the number of vowels in a given text using either a \"for\" loop or a \"while\" loop, or both if desired. Prompt the user to enter a text string. The program should then use the chosen loop approach(es) to iterate through each character in the string. For each character, the program should check if it is a vowel (regardless of the case) and increment the count if it is. Additionally, the program should print each vowel found in the text, along with the total count of vowels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "1. Prompt the user to input a text string using the `input()` function and store it in a variable called `user_input`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize a variable `vowels` with the string `'aeiou'`. This string contains all lowercase vowels, and we'll use it to check if a character is a vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (Option 1: For Loop Approach)\n",
    "   - Initialize a variable `count_for` with 0 to keep track of the number of vowels found using the \"for\" loop.\n",
    "   - Use a \"for\" loop to iterate through each character `char` in `user_input`.\n",
    "   - Convert the character to lowercase using `char.lower()` to handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels.\n",
    "   - Use an \"if\" statement to check if the lowercase character is in the `vowels` string. If it is, then it is a vowel, and we increment the `count_for` variable by 1.\n",
    "   - Optionally, print the vowel found in the string using `print(\"The vowel is:\", char)`.\n",
    "   - Continue with the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "   - After the loop finishes, print the total count of vowels found in the given text using `print(\"Total number of vowels using for loop:\", count_for)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (Option 2: While Loop Approach)\n",
    "   - Initialize a variable `count_while` with 0 to keep track of the number of vowels found using the \"while\" loop.\n",
    "   - Initialize a variable `index` with 0. This variable will keep track of the current index in the `user_input` while iterating through it.\n",
    "   - Initialize a variable `length` with the length of the `user_input` using the `len()` function. This will help us know where to stop incrementing the index.\n",
    "   - Use a \"while\" loop with the condition `index < length`. This ensures that we only loop through the characters of the string.\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, access the character at the current index using `user_input[index]`.\n",
    "   - Convert the character to lowercase using `user_input[index].lower()` to handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels.\n",
    "   - Use an \"if\" statement to check if the lowercase character is in the `vowels` string. If it is, then it is a vowel, and we increment the `count_while` variable by 1.\n",
    "   - Optionally, print the vowel found in the string using `print(\"The vowel is:\", user_input[index])`.\n",
    "   - Increment the `index` by 1 to move to the next character in the string.\n",
