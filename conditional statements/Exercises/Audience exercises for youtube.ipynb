    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a simple banking program to handle basic withdrawal and deposit transactions. The program will prompt the user to input the type of transaction they wish to perform, either a withdrawal or a deposit. Based on the transaction type, the program will execute the corresponding logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to develop a Python program that allows users to perform withdrawal or deposit transactions based on their choice. The program will interact with the user through the console, taking inputs and providing outputs accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program will start by prompting the user to enter the type of transaction they want to perform: either a \"withdraw\" or a \"deposit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the user enters \"withdraw,\" the program will proceed with the following steps:\n",
    "   - The user will be asked to enter their current account balance (integer value) from which they want to make the withdrawal.\n",
    "   - The user will then be asked to enter the amount they wish to withdraw (integer value).\n",
    "   - The program will check if the account balance is sufficient to complete the withdrawal.\n",
    "   - If the balance is greater than or equal to the withdrawal amount, the program will process the withdrawal by deducting the withdrawal amount from the account balance and displaying the updated balance.\n",
    "   - If the balance is less than the withdrawal amount, the program will display an \"Insufficient balance\" message, and the transaction will not be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the user enters \"deposit,\" the program will proceed with the following steps:\n",
    "   - The user will be asked to enter the amount they want to deposit (integer value).\n",
    "   - The program will display a message confirming the deposit of the specified amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the user enters any other transaction type besides \"withdraw\" or \"deposit,\" the program will display an \"Invalid transaction type\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The program should handle user input validation, ensuring that the entered values for the account balance, withdrawal amount, and deposit amount are valid integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Run:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter type of transaction: (withdraw/deposit): withdraw\n",
    "Account balance by checking: 1000\n",
    "Enter amount to withdraw: 500\n",
    "Amount withdrawn: 500\n",
    "Balance: 500\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter type of transaction: (withdraw/deposit): deposit\n",
    "Enter amount to deposit: 200\n",
    "Amount 200 is deposited\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter type of transaction: (withdraw/deposit): transfer\n",
    "Invalid transaction type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The program should continue running until the user decides to terminate it manually. For simplicity, we have omitted the loop structure in the problem description. However, you may want to include a loop to allow multiple transactions until the user chooses to exit the program."
