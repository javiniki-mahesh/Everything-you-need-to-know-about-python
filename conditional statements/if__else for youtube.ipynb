    "Conditional statements in Python allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. These statements enable you to execute specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are met. The basic conditional statements in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `if` statement: This statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `if...else` statement: This statement executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `if...elif...else` statement: This statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for these conditional statements is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `if` statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",

    "else:\n",
